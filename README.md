## PyWebDKP

PyWebDKP is a simple Python web wrapper for WebDKP. It can log in as an admin user and interact with some of the general database functions, which is useful for making third party bots.

See `example.py` for an example script.

The wrapper supports the following API commands:

- `login`
- `AddPlayer`
- `CreateItemAward`
- `CreateAward`
- `EditPlayer`
- Reading player information: ID, class, clan, and DKP for each pool.

I have no plans to update this project.
